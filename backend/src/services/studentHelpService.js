ORIGINAL QUESTION:
"${originalQuestion}"

CORRECT ANSWER:
"${correctAnswer}"

STUDENT CONTEXT:
- Recent correct rate: ${studentContext.recentCorrectRate || 'unknown'}%
- This student has been struggling (multiple wrong attempts)

YOUR TASK:
Create a SIMPLER version of this same question that:
1. Tests the same concept/learning objective
2. Uses simpler language and shorter sentences
3. Removes unnecessary complexity
4. Breaks down multi-part questions into one clear question
5. Provides more context or scaffolding

CRITICAL RULES:
- Must test the SAME concept (don't change the learning objective)
- Make it notably easier, not just slightly different
- Keep it a real question (not a fill-in-the-blank with obvious answer)
- High school level (don't talk down to them like children)

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no other text):

  "answer": "The correct answer to the simpler version",
  "scaffolding": "Optional hint or context to help them",
  "sameConceptCheck": "Brief note confirming this tests the same concept"

EXAMPLE:
Original: "Analyze how the author's use of metaphor in the third stanza contributes to the poem's overall theme of isolation."
Simpler: "What does the author compare loneliness to in the poem, and why do you think they chose that comparison?"`

CORRECT ANSWER:
"${correctAnswer}"

STUDENT'S ANSWER:
"${studentAnswer}"

CONTEXT:
- ${attemptContext}
- ${performanceContext}
- Subject: ${studentContext.subject || 'unknown'}

YOUR TASK:
Generate helpful feedback that:
1. Acknowledges their attempt (be encouraging, not condescending)
2. Explains what's wrong with THEIR SPECIFIC answer (not generic)
3. Provides a hint toward the right answer
4. Adjusts approach based on attempt number:
   - Attempt 1: Give hints, make them think, DON'T give the answer
   - Attempt 2: Be more direct, offer clearer guidance
   - Attempt 3+: Provide very direct help or offer simpler version

CRITICAL RULES:
- DON'T talk down to them (they're high schoolers, not children)
- BE SPECIFIC to their answer (not "that's wrong, try again")
- DON'T just give the answer on first attempt (make them think)
- On attempt 2+, be more helpful and offer simpler version
- Keep it brief (3-4 sentences max)

Attempt: 1

EXAMPLE 2 (Attempt 2):

Good Response:

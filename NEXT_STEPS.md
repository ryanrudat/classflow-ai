## 🚀 To Get Started (3 Required Steps)

### 1. Set Up Database (PostgreSQL)

**Option A: Install PostgreSQL Locally (Mac)**
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL
brew install postgresql@15
brew services start postgresql@15

# Create database
createdb classflow_ai

# Load schema
psql classflow_ai < database/schema.sql

# Verify tables
psql classflow_ai -c "\dt"
# Should show 7 tables
```

**Option B: Use Railway (Cloud Database)**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Create new project → Add PostgreSQL
3. Copy the DATABASE_URL
4. Update `backend/.env` with the Railway DATABASE_URL
5. Run schema in Railway's database interface

### 2. Get Claude API Key

1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Settings → API Keys → Create Key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)
5. Add $25 credit (Settings → Billing)
6. Update `backend/.env`:
   ```
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-actual-key-here
   ```

### 3. Start the Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Should see:
```
🚀 Server running on port 3000
📱 Frontend URL: http://localhost:5173
🔌 WebSocket ready
✅ Database connected
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Should see:
```
VITE v5.1.0  ready in 523 ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

### 1. Open Frontend
- Navigate to http://localhost:5173
- You should see the login page

### 2. Create Teacher Account
- Click "Sign up"
- Fill in your details

- Should redirect to dashboard

### 3. Create a Session
- Click "+ New Session"
- Enter title (e.g., "Period 3 - English")
- Select subject
- Click "Create Session"
- Note the join code (e.g., ABC123XY)

### 4. Test AI Generation
- Enter a prompt (e.g., "The American Revolution")
- Select content type (Reading Passage)
- Select difficulty (Medium)
- Click "✨ Generate Content"
- Wait for AI to generate (~5-10 seconds)
- Click "Push to All Students" when ready

### 5. Test Student View
- Open new browser window (or incognito)
- Go to http://localhost:5173
- It will redirect to login, but click the ClassFlow AI logo to go to home
- Or directly go to http://localhost:5173/join/ABC123XY (use your join code)
- Enter student name
- Click "Join Session"
- Should see "Waiting for teacher..."
- When teacher pushes content, it appears instantly!

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### `backend/.env`
```bash
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/classflow_ai
JWT_SECRET=ZwXspcAmIQ8O1QbpR+VAce567dW1aimnWrp1rtw6rDE=
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-api-key-here  # ⚠️ UPDATE THIS
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### `frontend/.env`

## 🎯 What Works Right Now

### ✅ Working Features
1. Teacher registration and login
2. Session creation with join codes
3. Student join (no login required)
4. AI content generation (with Claude API)
5. Real-time WebSocket communication
6. Live student tracking in teacher dashboard
7. Instant activity push to students
8. Student activity submission
9. Real-time response tracking
10. Screen lock/unlock (UI ready, backend ready)

### ⏳ What's Missing (For Full MVP)
1. Database must be set up
2. Claude API key must be added
3. Student authentication persistence could be improved
4. Analytics dashboard (Week 4 feature)
5. Mobile responsive polish

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Database connection failed"
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
brew services list | grep postgresql

# Restart if needed
brew services restart postgresql@15

# Verify database exists
psql -l | grep classflow_ai
```

### "Claude API error"
- Verify key in `backend/.env` (starts with `sk-ant-`)
- Check credits at https://console.anthropic.com/
- Make sure key is not wrapped in quotes

### "WebSocket not connecting"
- Check backend is running on port 3000
- Check `VITE_WS_URL` in `frontend/.env`
- Check browser console for connection errors

### "Port 3000 already in use"
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```
